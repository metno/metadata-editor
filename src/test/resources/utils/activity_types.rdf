Use hidden to identify common mis spellings...

Should be linked to GCMD Platforms

    <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">Activity Types</skos:prefLabel>
    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
Controlled vocabulary to be used in METAMOD context to describe activity
types. Rather than using the term observation type or platform which
possibly could describe the nature of observed datasets, activity type
is used to filter between both observations and simulations that
possibly are describing the same phenomena. Activity types are used to
identify the origin of the dataset documented within METAMOD. This is
not an identification of the observation platform (e.g. specific vessel,
        SYNOP station or satellite), but more the nature of the generation
process (e.g. simulation, in situ observation, remote sensing etc). It
is useful in the context of filtering data when searching for relevant
datasets.

Observations made during a flight trajectory. The observations can
include remote sensing instruments, dropsondes or in situ measurements.
Both manned and unmanned vehicles are covered by this term. The output
is typically a trajectory, but could also be profiles or points.

Observations or analysed products based upon data from a space borne
instrument (typically onboard a satellite). The nature of the output is
typically gridded of type imagery or profiles.

        <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
This indicates a dataset that has been generated by analysis of some
data with the emphasis on being representative in a climate context
(e.g. consistent in time). Furthermore, a climate indicator is a
"compact" representation of the feature studied (e.g. the temporal
        evolution of area covered by sea ice in the Arctic). Climate Indicators
are frequently linked to GCOS requirements.
